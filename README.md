# Time-Sensitive API Keys for Digital Content Access

Leverage Unkeyâ€™s short-lived keys to grant temporary access to digital content (e.g., e-books, videos, or streams), expiring after a set duration.

## Uniqueness

Many platforms lack simple time-based access controls or rely on complex, time-consuming setups. Unkey offers a quick, dynamic solution for trial versions, short-term access, or educational content management.

## Use Cases

Ideal for educational platforms, research papers, and subscription-based news services.

## Benefits

- **Security**: Content remains server-side, with access controlled by expiring API keys.
- **Control**: Easily revoke or limit access by managing key lifespans.
- **Scalability**: Suited for serverless or distributed systems.

## Demo App Overview

This demo provides time-limited access to specific pages of a PDF, without allowing full downloads. Each page request is authenticated with Unkey, ensuring access is controlled and expires as needed. The app streams individual PDF pages as users navigate through them.
